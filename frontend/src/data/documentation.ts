1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner
2. Select your preferred Stellar wallet (Freighter, xBull, or Lobstr)
3. Approve the connection request in your wallet
4. Your account will be automatically created and linked to your Stellar address

        answer: `PayD supports the following Stellar wallets:

- **Freighter**: The most popular Stellar wallet, perfect for beginners
- **xBull**: A mobile-first wallet with great UX
- **Lobstr**: Feature-rich wallet with built-in DEX access

We recommend Freighter for most users due to its seamless browser integration and active development.`,

- **Reports**: Generate custom payroll reports
- **Transactions**: View transaction history
- **Cross-Asset**: Make payments across different assets
- **Revenue Split**: Configure revenue sharing

        question: 'What is a trustline?',
        answer: `A **trustline** is a configuration on your Stellar account that allows you to hold a specific asset issued by another account.

**Key points:**
- Trustlines are required to receive non-native assets (anything other than XLM)
- Each trustline has a limit on how much of that asset you're willing to hold
- Setting up a trustline costs 0.5 XLM (which is held in reserve)
- You can remove trustlines if you no longer hold that asset

**In PayD context:**
Employees need to establish trustlines for the assets they'll receive as payment (e.g., USDC). PayD will guide you through this process when setting up payroll.`,

        question: 'What is an anchor?',
        answer: `An **anchor** is a regulated financial institution that bridges traditional banking systems with the Stellar network.

**Anchors provide:**
- Fiat on/off ramps (deposit/withdraw cash)
- Regulated stablecoins (like USDC on Stellar)
- KYC/AML compliance
- Regulatory oversight

**Popular anchors on Stellar:**
- **Circle**: Issues USDC on Stellar
- **MoneyGram**: Cash in/out locations worldwide
- **Stellar Term**: DEX with anchor integration

**In PayD context:**
PayD integrates with anchors to provide stablecoin payroll options, allowing employees to receive payments in assets backed by fiat currencies.`,

        question: 'What are claimable balances?',
        answer: `**Claimable balances** are a Stellar feature that allows sending payments to accounts that don't yet have a trustline for the asset.

**How they work:**
1. Sender creates a claimable balance with specific claim conditions
2. Recipient can claim the balance once they set up the required trustline
3. Claims can have time-based or predicate-based conditions

**Benefits for payroll:**
- Pay employees even if they haven't set up trustlines yet
- Schedule payments with future claim dates
- Provide clear instructions for employees to claim their funds

PayD uses claimable balances for seamless cross-asset payments.`,

        question: 'What is Soroban?',
        answer: `**Soroban** is Stellar's smart contract platform, enabling programmable transactions and complex business logic.

**Key features:**
- Turing-complete smart contracts
- Predictable gas fees
- State archival for cost efficiency
- Built-in oracle support

**In PayD context:**
PayD leverages Soroban contracts for:
- Automated payroll scheduling
- Multi-signature payment authorization
- Revenue splitting logic
- Custom payment conditions

The smart contracts handle complex payroll scenarios that wouldn't be possible with basic transactions.`,

        question: 'What is the minimum XLM balance?',
        answer: `Every Stellar account must maintain a **minimum balance of XLM** as reserve.

**Current requirements:**
- Base reserve: 0.5 XLM
- Each trustline: +0.5 XLM
- Each offer/signer: +0.5 XLM

**Example calculation:**
A new account with 2 trustlines needs:
- 2 XLM base (increased from 1 XLM in recent protocol updates)
- +1 XLM for 2 trustlines
- **Total: 3 XLM minimum**

**Important:**
You cannot spend below your minimum reserve. Ensure your account has sufficient XLM for operations plus reserves.`,

3. Click the **Cancel** button next to the payment
4. Confirm the cancellation

**Important notes:**
- Cancellations are only possible before the payment is broadcast to the network
- Once broadcast, transactions cannot be reversed

**1. Insufficient Balance**
- Verify you have enough of the payment asset
- Ensure you have XLM for transaction fees (0.00001 XLM per operation)
- Check that you're above minimum XLM reserve

**2. Missing Trustline**
- Ensure your account has the required trustline for the asset
- If paying in USDC, verify both sender and receiver have USDC trustlines

**3. Invalid Sequence Number**
- Wait a few seconds and retry (network congestion)
- Check for pending transactions in your wallet

**4. Wallet Connection Issues**
- Reconnect your wallet
- Clear browser cache and reload

**1. Verify Stellar Address**
- Confirm the address starts with 'G' (public key)
- Check for typos or formatting issues
- Test with a small amount first

**2. Check Trustlines**
- Employee must have trustline for non-XLM assets
- Use claimable balances if trustline isn't set up
- Guide employee through trustline setup

**3. Verify Account Status**
- Employee account must be funded (minimum 1 XLM)
- Account must not be frozen or locked

**4. Check Payment Status**
- View transaction history in the Transactions page
- Look for "pending" or "failed" statuses
- Contact support with transaction IDs for investigation

**Common simulation errors:**

**"insufficient funds"**
- Add more XLM or payment asset to your account
- Account for minimum reserves and fees

**"no trustline"**
- Set up the required trustline before sending
- Or use claimable balances for the recipient

**"op_underfunded"**
- Transaction fee amount unavailable
- Add XLM for network fees

**"op_malformed"**
- Invalid asset code or issuer
- Verify asset details in transaction

**How to fix:**
1. Read the error message in the Transaction Simulation Panel
2. Address the specific issue mentioned
3. Click "Reset" and try again with corrected parameters

- Look for the "Saving..." indicator near form fields
- "Last saved" timestamp shows when data was persisted

**To recover:**
1. Refresh the page if you accidentally closed it

3. Check the notification for "Recovered unsaved draft"

**If data is missing:**
- Check browser local storage isn't cleared
- Ensure you're on the same browser/device

**Best practices:**
- Don't clear browser data while working
- Complete and submit forms in one session when possible
- Export important reports for backup`,
