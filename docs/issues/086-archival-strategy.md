# #086: Implement Contract State Archival Strategy

**Category:** [CONTRACT]
**Difficulty:** ● HARD
**Tags:** `soroban`, `storage`, `archival`, `smart-contract`, `performance`

## Description

Develop and implement a strategy for managing Soroban's state archival requirements. This involves identifying which contract data (e.g., historical payroll runs, old employee records) should be moved to "persistent" storage vs. "temporary" storage, and implementing the necessary logic to extend the TTL (Time-To-Live) of critical entries.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit all contract state variables for storage type (Persistent vs. Temporary).
- [ ] Implement a `bump_ttl` function for critical data (e.g., active balances, organization config).
- [ ] Develop a mechanism to handle restored entries that have previously expired.
- [ ] Document the archival cycle and expected costs for the organization.
