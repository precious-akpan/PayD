**Difficulty:** ● HARD
**Tags:** `websocket`, `real-time`, `socket-io`

## Description

Integrate WebSockets (Socket.io or native) to provide real-time updates for transaction statuses. UI should reflect on-chain confirmations and balancing changes without a manual page refresh.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WebSocket connection established and managed.
- [ ] Real-time notifications for payment milestones.
- [ ] Graceful fallback to polling if WebSocket fails.
- [ ] State updates in React are efficient and atomized.
